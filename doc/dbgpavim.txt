*DBGPavim* is a plugin to enable php debug in VIM with Xdebug, which originates from http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1152.
But most of the code, especially the debugger backend has been rewritten.

Tested with --
* XDebug 2.2 - PHP 5.4 - GVIM 7.3 - Python 2.7 @ Windows 7 
* XDebug 2.0 - PHP 5.2 - VIM 7.3  - Python 2.7 @ Linux 
* XDebug 2.0 - PHP 5.2 - VIM 7.3  - Python 2.3 @ Linux 
* XDebug 2.2 - PHP 5.2 - VIM 7.3  - Python 2.7 @ Linux 

Some screenshots (under Windows 7) are here at http://sharing-from-brook.16002.n6.nabble.com/Debug-php-in-VIM-with-Xdebug-and-DBGPavim-td4930670.html.

## The *enhancements* are --

### Non blocking debugger backend.
So that VIM users do not need to wait for connection from apache server. No timeout things, users press F5 to start debugger backend, and uses his/her VIM normally. Debug backend won't stop users to interact with VIM. Users can press F6 to stop debugger backend anytime.

### Catch all connections from apache server.
This is very important for a large website, especially for thoes pages who contain AJAX requests. In that case, one reload of a page may trigger dozens of http request, each of them goes to a different URL. The new debugger backend will catch all connections from apache server. Users can debug all of them without missing anyone.

### Break only at breakpoints

    Now the debugger backend breaks only at breakpoints by default, if you would like the debugger backend to break at entry, then add below line to your vimrc --
    let g:dbgPavimBreakAtEntry = 1

### New *commands* and function keys

In normal mode

    <F5>      => start debugger backend
    <F6>      => stop debugger backend
    <F8>      => toggle dbgPavimBreakAtEntry, when g:dbgPavimBreakAtEntry=0, debugger backend breaks only at breakpoints.

    :Bl        => to list all breakpoints
    :Bp        => toggle breakpoint on current line
    :Dp [args] => to debug current file from CLI, it will run 'php -dxdebug.remote_autostart=1 -dxdebug.remote_port=<your_port> <curret_file_in_vim> [args]'

In debugging mode 

    <F1>      => toggle help window
    <F2>      => step into 
    <F3>      => step over 
    <F4>      => step out 
    <F5>      => start debugging / run
    <F6>      => stop debugging 
    <F7>      => evalute expression and display result. cursor is automatically move to watch window. type line and just press enter. 
    <F9>      => toggle layout
    <F11>     => shows all variables 
    <F12>     => shows variable on current cursor 

    :Pg        => to print value of complex variables like $this->savings[3]
    :Up        => goto upper level of stack 
    :Dn        => goto lower level of stack 

In Watch window

    If you press Enter key at a line which ends with --

    (object)  => to get value of an object.
    (array)   => to get value of an array.

    If you press Enter key at a line of output from command :Bl, that breakpoint will be located.

In Stack window

    If you press Enter key at a line, stack level will be set.

### Windows Support

### *Status* line for debugger backend

    After user press <F5> to start debugger backend, a string like "PHP-bae-LISN" will show up at the right side of status line.

    The status string looks like -- 

    PHP-<bae|bap>-<LISN|PENDn|CONN|CLSD>

    bae       => means Break At Entry
    bap       => means Break only At breakPoints

    LISN      => means the debugger backend is listening.
    PENDn     => means there are n connections waiting for debugging.
    CONN      => means debug session has been established, and being debugged.
    CLSD      => means the debugger backend has stopped.

### New layout of windows

### Remote debugging

    In case that you need run VIM on a different machine from server where apache httpd runs, configuration for DBGPavim --

    let g:dbgPavimPathMap = [['D:/works/php','/var/www'],]

    Some change for Apache configuration is also necessary --

    php_value xdebug.remote_host <ip_address_where_you_run_vim>

## *Usage*

* Make sure your vim has python(at least 2.3) supported, in vim with command

    :version

    In case of your VIM don't support python, download VIM source package from http://www.vim.org/download.php, then build your own VIM with commands --

    ./configure --prefix=/opt/vim --enable-pythoninterp --with-python-config-dir=/usr/lib/python2.4/config
    make
    make install

* Install xdebug for php, and edit php.ini

    zend_extension=path_to_xdebug.so
    xdebug.remote_enable=1

* Edit your ~/.vimrc

    let g:dbgPavimPort = 9009
    let g:dbgPavimBreakAtEntry = 0

* Edit your apche configure file

    In your VirtualHost section, set debugger port same as the one in your vimrc

    php_value xdebug.remote_port 9009

* Save dbgpavim.py and dbgpavim.vim to your ~/.vim/plugin

* Open your php file, use :Bp to set breakpoints

* Now, press F5 to start debugger backend

* Back to your browser, add XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1 to your URL, for example, http://localhost/index.php?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1.

If you are tied of adding XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1 in query string, there is a XDEBUG_SESSION helper at http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/132695, a user script for Google Chrome. It also works for Firefox with help of GreaseMonkey.

Or modify your apache configuration(httpd.conf) --

  <VirtualHost>
      ...
      php_value xdebug.remote_port 9009
      php_value xdebug.remote_autostart 1
  </VirtualHost>

## CLI debugging

* If you would like to debug from CLI, start your php script like 

    php -dxdebug.remote_autostart=1 -dxdebug.remote_port=9009 test.php

* There is new command :Dp to debug current file. :Dp command is to launch current file with

    php -dxdebug.remote_autostart=1 -dxdebug.remote_port=9009

## Python debugging
DBGPavim is both a DBGP protocol server and VIM debugger backend, it can help to debug Python code.
I haved tried it with --
* Komodo Python Remote Debugging Client --Python 2.7 - MacVim 7.3 @ Mac OS X 10.8

1. Download Komodo Python Remote Debugging Client from http://code.activestate.com/komodo/remotedebugging/, for Mac, it's Komodo-PythonRemoteDebugging-7.1.2-73175-macosx-x86.tar.gz (Refer to http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/4.4/debugpython.html)

2. Open the python script file with VIM, and Press <F5> to listen.

3. extract the package, and run

    bin/pydbgp -d 127.0.0.1:9000 /works/scriptbundle/python/playpen.py

4. then the others are same as php debugging.
